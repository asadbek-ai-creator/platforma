# Role-Based Routing Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Teacher Page Created
**File:** `app/teacher/page.tsx`
- Modern, professional design with Tailwind CSS
- Uzbek language UI
- Welcome message with teacher's name
- Logout functionality
- Teacher-specific features:
  - Student list management
  - Class schedule
  - Grade entry
  - Reports and analytics
- Role-based access control (only TEACHER role allowed)

### 2. Student Page Created
**File:** `app/student/page.tsx`
- Matching design with teacher page
- Uzbek language UI
- Welcome message with student's name

### 3. User API Endpoint Created
**File:** `app/api/auth/user/route.ts`
- GET endpoint to fetch current user
- Returns: `{ user: { id, name, role } }` or `{ user: null }`
- Checks session cookie for user_id
- Queries Supabase for user data

### 4. Login Page Updated with Role-Based Redirects
**File:** `app/login/page.tsx` (lines 25-93)

**Login Flow:**
```typescript
- User logs in with name
- API returns user data with role
- Store user in localStorage
- Redirect based on role:
  * TEACHER → /teacher
  * STUDENT → /student
  * Default → /dashboard
```

**Registration Flow:**
```typescript
- User registers with name + role
- API creates user and returns data
- Store user in localStorage
- Redirect based on role:
  * TEACHER → /teacher
  * STUDENT → /student
  * Default → /dashboard
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Route Protection
Both teacher and student pages implement:
- Authentication check on page load
- Role verification
- Automatic redirect to /login if:
  - User not authenticated
  - Wrong role for the page
  - API request fails

### Session Management
- Cookie-based sessions (HTTP-only)
- LocalStorage for quick access to user data
- Logout clears both cookie and localStorage
